These codes perform physics-driven deep learning inversion of the transient electromagnetic data
train_PhyDLI.m Matlab script loads synthetic data and models to train a neural network 
This code is executed at each PhyDLI cycles after updating the training data set with early inversion results.
Each line of the code has comments explaining the variables and settings.
                              
PhyDLI.m Matlab script reproduces two main figures
It illustrates the prediction improvement from the first training data set to final training data set
Data_OriginalPrediction_PhyDLI_Prediction.fig : This figure illustrates the prediction improvement with PhyDLI cycles over individual soundings
Training_testing_first_and_final_prediction.fig: This figure illustrates the prediction improvement with PhyDLI cycles over the entire test data set by histogram plots

Script does the following steps:
Load pretrained neural networks 
Load the testing (Alien) data and models
Make predictions
Calculate model RMS and make plots
Load the original training data and models
Plot test models and their predictions from first training and final training
Plot histograms of training model, testing model and predictions
